# Templates

To use the templates, please, be kind to call the function:

```{r, include = TRUE, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
MaxWiK::MaxWiK_templates(dir = tempdir())
```

The function MaxWiK_templates() copies all the templates to the working folder. There are 3 templates:

-   MaxWiK.ABC.R - template to run approximate Bayesian computation based on MaxWiK algorithms including metasampling;

-   MaxWiK.Sampling.R - template to run sampling generation and run a model with example of Gaussian function;

-   MaxWiK.Predictor.R - template to get prediction based on metasampling procedure.

One can find the explanation of leveraging of the templates in this vignette.
