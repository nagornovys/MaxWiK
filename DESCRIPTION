Description: This software is a package named **MaxWiK** contains Approximate Bayesian Computation method to choose a single parameter for a single observation point. The method involves the transformation of row data to a Hilbert space (mapping) and the measurement of the similarity between simulated points and maxima weighted Isolation Kernel mapping related to the observation point. We also design a heuristic algorithm for parameter estimation that requires no calculation and is dimension independent.
