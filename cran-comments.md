-   checking for non-standard things in the check directory ... NOTE Found the following files/directories: ‘MaxWiK.ABC.R’ ‘MaxWiK.Predictor.R’ ‘MaxWiK.Sampling.R’

### Answers on NOTES:

1.  

Iurii and Nagornov are the correct spelling of the author's name. Actually I use Yuri and Iurii spelling in different cases.

And this is the submission of a new package.

2.  

Files ‘MaxWiK.ABC.R’ ‘MaxWiK.Predictor.R’ ‘MaxWiK.Sampling.R’ are used as templates for demonstration of the machine learning method for three different problems. They are described in the vignette.
